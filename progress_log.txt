This app only has 2 of the game modes working. These would be the Standard Mode and the Boss Rush Mode. There are also no assets used for
character and boss portraits. Gameplay has been slightly balanced from its previous iterations yet it still needs a lot more runs of play
testing.

To-Do-List

Update the combat system
- make the battle queue work with boss speed in mind
- give the ability for variable/longer battle logs
- make space for "animations" to run
- fully skip dialogue when dead

Add new combat capabilities
- allow the user to target allies for certain skills
  - examples: pick a target for Cover and Holy Water/Well
- give bosses and attacks different resistances
  - this would boost the power of Sages and add more involved gameplay with one
  
Refactor and Maintenance
- fix the damage formula to be more consistent and modular
- fix the UI for character buttons and selections in battle
- add the UI for the title and the menu buttons
- add a way to permanently save boss records
- tweak the buff/debuff system for ease of use
