Synopsis

Create a team of 4 heroes to use in combat against a boss or bosses depending on the game mode. The party shares one mana pool to use
their abilities so careful consideration is placed on party formation and turn-by-turn decision making. The goal is to defeat each boss
with your favorite parties, but an added goal is to do it quickly.

Status

Currently in a semi-playable state. The game functions but is not up to the 
desired standard. Its current form mainly works as a showcase or demo of what
could be. See the progress log to see where it stands and future revisions 
needed.
