Turn-Based Mobile Game made with Java

Synopsis
Create a team of 4 heroes to use in combat against a boss or bosses depending on the game mode. The party shares one mana pool to use
their abilities so careful consideration is placed on party formation and turn-by-turn decision making. The goal is to defeat each boss
with your favorite parties, but an added goal is to do it quickly.

Features
5 Playable classes - Emperor, Saint, Enchantress, Sage, and Pirate
4 Fightable bosses - Shae D., Miss Lead, Ruhtra, and Den Mo
3 Playable game modes - Standard, Boss Rush, Reversal

Status
Currently in a semi-playable state. The game functions but is not up to the desired standard. Its current form mainly works as a showcase
or demo of what could be. See the progress log to see where it stands and future revisions needed.
